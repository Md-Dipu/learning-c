## Documentation: Learning Basics of C Programing

<!-- short description -->

This is a 7-day plan to learn the basics of C language and make some simple projects. Learning the very basics of wiring a c program is the main goal.

<!-- plan structure -->

> Day 1

Day one is mainly for starting C programming. Also, learn about variables and numbers. And general mathematical operation.

- Hello World!
- Variables / Primary Datatype / Constants
- Working with numbers: Mathematical Operator
- Common Errors

> Day 2

Day two for learning conditional statements with if-else and switch. Conditional Statements are used to make decisions based on the conditions. So it's a feature of C to control program flow.

- if-else, else-if, and nested if-else
- Logical operator
- Ternary operator
- Switch

> Day 3

Day three is for three topics loops, function, and libraries. Learning about basic loops like while-loop, do-while, and for-loop, break and continue, basics of function, and some useful standard libraries and their functions, basics of custom library are the main part of day three.

- while-loop
- do-while
- for-loop
- Nested loop
- Basics of function
- Standard libraries
- Basics of custom library

> Day 4

Day four is for learning arrays and structure, use of typedef to define a custom type.

- Arrays
- Structure
- typedef
- Pointer

> Day 5

Day five is for problem-solving in c. The problems are very easy and simply suitable for beginners.

- Reverse string
- Transform string to uppercase and lowercase
- Sum all the numbers in an array
- Sort array of number
- Count vowel in the string
- Count total marks boys and girls from the list
- Count working days

> Day 6

Day six is for project one which is a two-player mood console game name tic tac tao.

- Project 1: Tic tac tao (Game: 2 player mood)

> Day 7

Day seven and the final day is for project two which is a console application to register new students with their details. The project title is Student Register.

- Project 2: Student Register

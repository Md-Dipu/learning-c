## Documentation: Learning Basics of C Programing

<!-- short description -->

This is a 7-day plan to learn the basics of C language and make some simple projects. Learning the very basics of wiring a c program is the main goal.

<!-- plan structure -->

> Day 01

Day one is mainly for starting C programming. Also, learn about variables and numbers. And general mathematical operation.

- Hello World!
- Variables / Primary Datatype / Constants
- Working with numbers: Mathematical Operator
- Common Errors

> Day 02

Day two for learning conditional statements with if-else and switch. Conditional Statements are used to make decisions based on the conditions. So it's a feature of C to control program flow.

- If-else, else-if and nexted if-else

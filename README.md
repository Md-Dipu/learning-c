## Documentation: Learning Basics of C Programing

<!-- short description -->

This is a 7-day plan to learn the basics of C language and make some simple projects. Learning the very basics of wiring a c program is the main goal.

<!-- plan structure -->

> Day 1

Day one is mainly for starting C programming. Also, learn about variables and numbers. And general mathematical operation.

- Hello World!
- Variables / Primary Datatype / Constants
- Working with numbers: Mathematical Operator
- Common Errors

> Day 2

Day two for learning conditional statements with if-else and switch. Conditional Statements are used to make decisions based on the conditions. So it's a feature of C to control program flow.

- if-else, else-if, and nested if-else
- Logical operator
- Ternary operator
- Switch

> Day 3

Day three is for loops. The central part of day three is learning about basic loops like while-loop, do-while, and for-loop, nested loop with while and for, break and continue.

- while-loop
- do-while
- for-loop
- Nested loop

> Day 4

Day four is for learning array and string. Declaring, initiation, and use of array and string are day five topics.

- 1D Arrays
- 2D Arrays
- String

> Day 5

Day five is for function. How to declare and call a function, and use of parameters, return of function is the central part of day five.

- What is a function?
- Declaring and Calling
- Parameters
- return and void function

> Day 6

Day six is for problem-solving in c. The problems are very easy and simple, suitable for beginners.

- Reverse string
- Transform string to uppercase and lowercase
- Count vowel in the string
- Sum all the numbers in an array
- Matching array of numbers
- Count total marks boys and girls

> Day 7

Day saven is for project which is a two-player mood console game name tic tac tao.

- Project: Tic tac tao (Game: 2 player mood)
